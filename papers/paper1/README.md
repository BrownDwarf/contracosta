## contracosta paper 1

- **Introduction: Starspot properties**
  - Cite the NASA ExoPag SAG21
  - Cite Xiang-Song Fang et al. 2016 starspot contrast with LAMOST
  - Cite Beryugina et al.
  - Key question: How do we know starspot contrast? Where do constraints actually come from?
- **Data and reduction**
  - TESS
    - [ ] Sectors and cadence overlap
    - [ ] Extraction with Lightkurve
    - [ ] How many sources
  - Kepler/K2
    - [ ] How many campaigns and quarters, basic properties...
  - ASASSN
    - [ ] Bandpass, number of visits, masking
  - **Figure 1**: TESS and ASASSN data overlay with IGRINS epochs
- **Methodology: Bandpass differences**
  - Figure Idea: A flux ratio heatmap of Teff vs Tspot for TESS/K2
- **Analysis**
- **Results**
- **Discussion**
  - Questioning the assumptions of the method
