Starspots confound derived stellar properties and a concept for probabilistic mitigation
---
TESS Cycle 2 Proposal

1. Introduction
2. Scientific Justification
  - Spots as confounders of isochronal ages
    - Cite Somers papers
  - Transit light source effect
    - Rackham papers
    - Astro2020 white paper
  - Stellar surface structures as a gateway for brown dwarf cloud modeling
    - Cite Arizona group, starry; tradeoff in fidelity and scalability
3. Analysis Plan
  - Get amplitudes and periods for a large fraction of stars from TESS data
  - Compute the typical ratio of Kepler/K2 amplitudes to TESS amplitudes at given SpT/rotation rate to measure spot contrast difference
  - Get starspot temperature and coverage fraction for a subsample of these stars from spectroscopy
  - Compute the ratio of TESS amplitude to total spot coverage
  - Compute a regression of spot coverage to rotation rate and spectral subtype.  
4. Technical Feasibility
  - Essentially measuring amplitudes, which has been demonstrated
  - There will be enough GKM stars
  - The TESS precision will be adequate
  - I have already applied the spectral technique to a wide range of young stars
  - Availability of archival spectroscopy
5. Expected Impact
  - Probabilistic lookup table for spot coverage
  - Direct estimate of spot coverage for selected high value targets
  - Gateway to future investigation pathways:
    - Trends in spot coverage with lightcurve periodic substructure
    - Trends in spot coverage with lightcurve high frequency residual substructure
6. Work Plan
  - Derive amplitudes and periods for large sample of TESS sources.
  - Select targets based on ranges of TESS rotation rate
  - Observe or data mine archival spectroscopy
  - Write up
