PI will carry out the time series data analysis using a combination of new and existing scripts built upon the heritage of the Kepler/K2 data analysis ecosystem, including but not limited to the lightkurve and celerite framewroks.  The PI will first apply scripts to both K2 and TESS lightcurves.  Undergraduate and/or graduate student(s) will lead the application of TESS-adapted scripts to TESS Full-Frame Image (FFI) lightcurves with TESS-cut and/or elenor.  All reproducible scripts---including Jupyter Notebook tutorials---will be made publicly available.
PI will provide students with an interactive tool to visualize periodic lightcurve structures to aid rapid visual spot-checking of analysis output.  Finally, a High-Level Science Product (HLSP) will be delivered to MAST that contains the following information for each star found to possess detectable starspot-induced lightcurve modulation: 1) the period or periods, 2) an iteratively determined outlier mask of stellar flares, occultations, or spurious data artifacts, 3) a background-star amplitude-dilution estimate, 4) a probability distribution for the spot temperature spot contrast ratio, 5) addition model fitting metadata.  PI may co-advise---with Co-I---students in the writeup of the paper(s), authored and/or coauthored by students.
