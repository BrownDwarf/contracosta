TESS Cycle 2
---
Proposal outline

1. Introduction
2. Scientific Justification
  - Spots as confounders of isochronal ages
  - Transit light source effect
  - Stellar surface structures as a gateway for brown dwarf cloud modeling
3. Analysis Plan
  - Starspot contrast
  - Secular evolution in concert with ground-based photometry
4. Technical Feasibility
  - Essentially measuring amplitudes, which has been demonstrated.  
5. Expected Impact
  - Transferring high fidelity spectroscopic measurements to high-scalability (all-sky) TESS will deliver probabilistic lookup table for spot coverage
  - Lookup tables for surface coverage fractions will aid planning for JWST observation planning and coarse TLSE corrections
