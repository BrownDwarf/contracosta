%% Feel free to modify the included packages list to use your

%% In the graphics and graphicx packages, Postscript and eps figures
%% can be included using the \includegraphics command. The graphics
%% package is part of standard LaTeX2e and provides a basic way of including a
%% figure. The graphicx package is not standard, but extends the
%% \includegraphics command to make it more user-friendly. If graphicx
%% is not available on your system please remove it from the list of
%% included packages above.

%% Syntax:
%% In the graphics package:
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[llx,lly][urx,ury]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where ll denotes 'lower left' and ur 'upper right' and the x and y
%% values are the coordinates of the PostScript bounding box in
%% points. There are 72 points in an inch.
%%
%% In the graphicx package:
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[key=val,key=val,...]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where some of the useful keys are: angle, width, height,
%% keepaspectratio (='true' or 'false') and scale. Bounding box values
%% can be given as [bb=llx lly urx ury].
%%
%% In either case you have to use LaTeX figure placement commands to
%% position the figure on the page; \includegraphics will not do
%% that. Both these commands also have other options that are listed
%% in the LaTeX manual (for the graphics package) and in 'The LaTeX
%% Graphics Companion' (for the graphicx package).

\section{Introduction}

Summarize the problem being addressed and give an overview of how your investigation will help.
Why \tess, why now?


\section{Scientific Justification}



\subsection{Starspots as confounders of isochronal ages}
Provide text and figures that justify the scientific need for \tess\ observations and analyses here.
Justify your choice of cadence. When applicable, justify your choice of new 2 min cadence observations.
If your program includes theoretical, simulation, or ground-based observing components (limited to no
more than 30\% effort), describe why these efforts are critical in addition to \tess\ observations.

For example, see \cite{2015ApJ...807..174S} and \cite{2015arXiv150706460F}).  Specifically, stellar evolution models

%% comment this section out on proposals not asking for
%% Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations.

\subsection{Stellar surface structures as a gateway for brown dwarf cloud modelin}

\section{Analysis Plan}

\subsection{Get amplitudes and periods for a large fraction of stars from TESS data}
\subsection{Compute the typical ratio of Kepler/K2 amplitudes to TESS amplitudes at given SpT/rotation rate}
\subsection{Interpret the Tess/Kepler ratios as spot contrast differences}
\subsection{Get starspot temperature and coverage fraction for a subsample of these stars from spectroscopy}
\subsection{Compute the ratio of TESS amplitude to total spot coverage}
\subsection{Compute a regression of spot coverage to rotation rate and spectral subtype.}


\section{Technical Feasibility}

\subsection{Measuring periods and amplitudes, which has been demonstrated}
\subsection{There will be enough GKM stars}
\subsection{The TESS precision will be adequate}
\subsection{Experience with the spectral technique on young stars}
\subsection{Availability of archival spectroscopy}


\section{Expected Impact}

\subsection{Probabilistic lookup table for spot temperature and spot coverage}
\subsection{Direct estimate of spot coverage for selected high value targets}
\subsection{Gateway to future investigation pathways}
\subsubsection{Trends in spot coverage with lightcurve periodic substructure}
\subsubsection{Trends in spot coverage with lightcurve high frequency residual substructure}
\subsubsection{Trends in spot coverage with lightcurve high frequency residual substructure}


\section{Work Plan}

MGS will carry out the data analysis using custom scripts that build upon the heritage of the Kepler data analysis ecosystem, including \texttt{lightkurve}, \texttt{astropy}, \texttt{celerite}, \texttt{BombScargle}, and \texttt{bokeh}.  MGS will first apply these scripts to Kepler SAP lightcurves or detrended K2 data while in his current role as support scientist at the Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office.  MGS will adapt and apply these scripts to TESS data---in the event of GI proposal selection---starting in Fall 2019.  All scripts will be publicly available and developed openly on GitHub, including tutorial Jupyter Notebooks.  MGS will produce an interactive \texttt{bokeh} tool to visualize the Fourier decomposition of a periodic lightcurve into its constituent components.  This tool will leverage the PI's familiarity with \texttt{bokeh}, to aid students' visualization different amplitudes.  A machine readable database will be produced that contains the following information for each star found to possess starspot-induced lightcurve modulation: 1) the period, 2) an iteratively determined mask of stellar flares and/or spurious data artifacts, 3) a vector of Chebychev polynomial coefficients to account for any long-term normalization trends on timescales comparable to the observation window, and 4) a vector of Fourier amplitudes that can reconstruct the periodic structures in the lightcurve to within the signal-to-noise ratio of the data.
