%% Feel free to modify the included packages list to use your

%% In the graphics and graphicx packages, Postscript and eps figures
%% can be included using the \includegraphics command. The graphics
%% package is part of standard LaTeX2e and provides a basic way of including a
%% figure. The graphicx package is not standard, but extends the
%% \includegraphics command to make it more user-friendly. If graphicx
%% is not available on your system please remove it from the list of
%% included packages above.

%% Syntax:
%% In the graphics package:
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[llx,lly][urx,ury]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where ll denotes 'lower left' and ur 'upper right' and the x and y
%% values are the coordinates of the PostScript bounding box in
%% points. There are 72 points in an inch.
%%
%% In the graphicx package:
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[key=val,key=val,...]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where some of the useful keys are: angle, width, height,
%% keepaspectratio (='true' or 'false') and scale. Bounding box values
%% can be given as [bb=llx lly urx ury].
%%
%% In either case you have to use LaTeX figure placement commands to
%% position the figure on the page; \includegraphics will not do
%% that. Both these commands also have other options that are listed
%% in the LaTeX manual (for the graphics package) and in 'The LaTeX
%% Graphics Companion' (for the graphicx package).

\section{Introduction}

Summarize the problem being addressed and give an overview of how your investigation will help.
Why \tess, why now?


\section{Scientific Justification}



\subsection{Starspots as confounders of isochronal ages}
Provide text and figures that justify the scientific need for \tess\ observations and analyses here.
Justify your choice of cadence. When applicable, justify your choice of new 2 min cadence observations.
If your program includes theoretical, simulation, or ground-based observing components (limited to no
more than 30\% effort), describe why these efforts are critical in addition to \tess\ observations.

For example, see \cite{2015ApJ...807..174S} and \cite{2015arXiv150706460F}).  Specifically, stellar evolution models


%% Trigger Criteria section:
%% comment this section out on proposals not asking for
%% Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations.

\subsection{Transit light source effect}
thinga

\subsection{Stellar surface structures as a gateway for brown dwarf cloud modelin}
more yjumd


\section{Analysis Plan}

\subsection{Get amplitudes and periods for a large fraction of stars from TESS data}
\subsection{Get starspot temperature and coverage fraction for a sample of these stars from spectroscopy}
\subsection{Compute the ratio of TESS amplitude to total spot coverage}
\subsection{Compute a regression of spot coverage to rotation rate and spectral subtype.}


\section{Technical Feasibility}

\subsection{Essentially measuring periods and amplitudes, which has been demonstrated}
\subsection{There will be enough GKM stars}
\subsection{The TESS precision will be adequate}
\subsection{I have already applied the spectral technique to a wide range of young stars}
\subsection{Availability of archival spectroscopy}


\section{Expected Impact}

Summarize the expected science return of the proposed investigations and the expected benefit
to the community, including new data products and software tools to be made publicly available.


\section{Work Plan}

Provide a brief (1 paragraph) work plan that provides details on how the proposed effort will be carried out, including the allocation of effort amongst investigators. Investigators who are proposing to continue a program that was selected for funding in Cycle 1 must describe why additional funds are required in Cycle 2. All proposals requesting funds must also provide upon submission a bottom-line budget number in the provided field of the ARK submission form; this number should not be included in the body of the proposal.

\section{References}

List of references. References {\it are included} when considering the proposal 4 page limit.
\bibliography{tessgi_gully_cycle2}


\section{Target Table}

When necessary to justify your proposal, provide a list of targets using the below example as
a template for format. This target table is designed to aid reviewers and need only provide a
representative sample of the complete target list uploaded to RPS. Full target tables should be
submitted electronically with the Phase-1 proposal. Please limit this target table to only 1 page.
The table is {\it not included} in the 4 page limit of the Science/Technical section. Proposals including
a target table may be up to 5 pages in length, but only the target table may appear on page 5.
